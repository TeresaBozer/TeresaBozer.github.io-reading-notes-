## Programming with JS

# MDN Control Flow

- definition: order in which computer excutes script
- from 1st to last unless a structure changes flow - ex loop, conditional, functions

# Functions

- definition - designed to excute particular task
- "something" has to invoke it
- how to name a function / function keyword, name, parentheses
- functions can contain letteres, digits, undescores and $
- The code to be excuted by the function is placed inside curly braces
- Function parameters are in the parentheses
- Function arguments are values received by the function when it is invoked.
- Inside the function, the aruments - ie parameters- behave as local variables
- same as procedure or subroutine in other programming languages.
- ways to invoke function: event occurs, ex. button click/ js code / automatically
- when reaches function return - function will stop excecuting
- if invoked from statement, js will return to execute the code after the invoking statement
- F often compute a return value which goes to the "caller"
- why functions - create once, use many times
- must have parentheses to invoke function
- can use function as variable values
- variabe in function become local to function
- since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variable with the same name can be used in different functions

# Operators

- = assigns value to variable
- + adds numbers or strings
- * multiplies
- ** exponent
- / division
- % division remainder
- ++ increment
- -- decrement
- += adds value to variable or to add strings
- string + number = 2 strings
- == equal to
