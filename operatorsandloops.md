## Expressions and operators

# Assignment

- the symbol for the math goes on the left x += f()
- symbols + - * / % ** exponentiation etc.
- assignments are used within variable declarations or as standalones
- discouraged: chaining or neting assignments

# Comparison operators

- compares operands (numerical, string, logical, object values) and returns whether statement true
- == equal - tries to fix to make equal ex: 3 == '3'
- === strictly equal - does not fix ex: 3 is not strictly equal to '3'
- != not equal - returns true if not equal
- !== strictly not equal - ditto
- > greater than
- < less than
- >= greater than or equal
- <= less than or equal

# Loops

- quick easy to perform something repeatedly
- statement types in js
-- for - repeats until specified condition evaluates to FALSE
-- do...while - repeats until specified condition evaluates to FALSE
-- while - executes until specified condition evaluates to TRUE
-- labeled - statement with an identifier so you can refer to it elsewhere in program
-- break - terminates a loop, switch or in conjunction with a labeled statement
-- continue - to restart a while, do-while, for or label statement
-- for...in - iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object
-- for...of - creates a loop iteratin over iterable objects such as array, map, set, arguments, object, etc. invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property
