# Structure Web Pages with HTML

## Wireframe and Design

- used by UX desingers to plan info hierarchy for website, app, etc.
- is a plan for how user will process info on site
- done in black and white just to show position of items, labels but no words or code
- software for ex: Invision, UXPin, Wirefram.cc or Balsamiq or could just draw by hand
- initial paper and pen or whiteboard drawing is easiest to change and then can transfer to software product *see above
- Examples of process from design to implementation:

> Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
> Sketch > Code
> Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
> Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

- Steps to Wireframing
> _Step 1_research audience, competitors, best practice, look outside of your subject area for examples
> _Step 2_ keep notes
> _Step 3_ map user flow
> _Step 4_ sketch - keep in mind
>> How can you organise the content to support your usersâ€™ goals?
>>Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
>>What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
>>Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?
- _Step 5_ create skeleton and test, keep in mind
> usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on
> Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action
> Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?
> Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition
- now test - use colleague, software lik UsabilityHub and Prott to test
- _Step 6_ Turn wireframe into prototype - tools to use are Proto.io, Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma and Framer

- Keys to good wireframe: clarity of site, user confidence, simplicity

## HTML

- markup language, defines structure of content, enclosing tags define what happens to text
- element = opening tag + closing tag + content
- elements can have attributes WITHIN OPENING TAG: class="editor-note"
- nesting elements around certain text only ex: strong around a word
- empty element like img
- parts of HMTL - see book or website

## Semantics

- the use of real words to give meaning to the code
