## Growth Mindset

This is the belief that one can learn regardless of one's talents and innate abilities.  It may take some people longer than others to reach the same level of competence.  Growth mindset is the willingness to persevere, regardless of the challenges that one will face.

### Things to remember
1. It will not always be easy, but so what.  I have been through plenty of hard things.
2. I have always been a willing learner, and I can learn this too.
3. I know how to make use of resources.  I am willing to ask for help.
