##Growth Mindset
This is the belief that one can learn regardless of your talents and innate abilities.  It may take some people longer than others to reach the same level of competence; however, one must be willing to persevere, regardless of the challenges that one will face.
Things to remember
1.  It will not always be easy, but so what.  I have been through plenty of hard things.
  - I have always been a willing learner, and I can learn this too.
    - I know how to make use of resources.  I am willing to ask for help.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TeresaBozer/TeresaBozer.github.io-reading-notes-/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TeresaBozer/TeresaBozer.github.io-reading-notes-/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
